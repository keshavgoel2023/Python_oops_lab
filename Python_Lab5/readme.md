Lab 5: Map and reduce functions
1.	Write a Python program to triple all numbers in a given list of integers. Use Python map. 
2.	Write a Python program to add three given lists using Python map and lambda.
3.	Write a Python program to listify the list of given strings individually using Python map. 
4.	Write a Python program to create a list containing the power of said number in bases raised to the corresponding number in the index using Python map. 
5.	Write a Python program to square the elements of a list using the map() function. 
6.	Write a Python program to convert all the characters into uppercase and lowercase and eliminate duplicate letters from a given sequence. Use the map() function. 
7.	Write a Python program to add two given lists and find the di∆Øerence between them. Use the map() function. 
8.	Write a Python program to convert a given list of integers and a tuple of integers in a list of strings. 
9.	Write a Python program to create a new list taking specific elements from a tuple and convert a string value to an integer. 
10.	Write a Python program to compute the square of the first N Fibonacci numbers, using the map function and generate a list of the numbers. 
11.	Write a Python program to compute the sum of elements of an array of integers. Use the map() function.
